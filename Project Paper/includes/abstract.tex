Climate scientists write a number of applications to simulate aspects of our
planet's ecosystem. These are sometimes coupled with other simulations using
model coupling frameworks. This improves the accuracy of results and allows
climate scientists to model more complicated scenarios. The Glasgow Model
Coupling Framework (GMCF) is a new kind of model coupling framework that can
also be used to parallelise individual models. By comparing LES performance when
parallelised by MPI and GMCF, it is shown that GMCF offers competitive
performance with MPI while also providing model coupling functionality.
