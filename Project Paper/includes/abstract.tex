Climate scientists write code to simulate aspects of our planet's ecosystem.
These are sometimes coupled with other models using model coupling frameworks.
GMCF is a new kind of model coupling framework that can also be used to
parallelise individual models. By comparing an MPI LES and GMCF LES, it is shown
that GMCF is competitive performance-wise with MPI while also providing model
coupling functionality.
