Climate scientists write a number of applications to simulate aspects of our
planet's ecosystem. These are sometimes coupled with other models using model
coupling frameworks to improve the accuracy of results or to model more
complicated scenarios. The Glasgow Model Coupling Framework (GMCF) is a new kind
of model coupling framework that can also be used to parallelise individual
models. By comparing an MPI LES and GMCF LES, it is shown that GMCF is
competitive performance-wise with MPI while also providing model coupling
functionality.
