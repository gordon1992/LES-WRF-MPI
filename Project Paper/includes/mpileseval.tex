The performance evaluation is split into two: a shared memory performance
scaling evaluation on a 64 core machine, and a distributed memory performance
evaluation on a cluster on up to 12 nodes.

\subsection{Shared-memory parallelisation}

togian - Quad socket AMD Opteron 6366HE system. 64 cores 32 modules running at
1.8GHz (turbo disabled). 512GB DDR3 RAM.

\subsection{Distributed-memory paralellism}

Results were obtained using the EPSRC funded ARCHIE-WeSt High Performance
Computer (\url{www.archie-west.ac.uk}). EPSRC grant no. EP/K000586/1.

Each node has two Intel Xeon X5650 CPUs. 12 cores running at 2.66GHz (with
turbo). 48GB RAM 4xQDR Infiniband Interconnect
