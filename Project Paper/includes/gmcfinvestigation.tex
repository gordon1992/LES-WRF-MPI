The GMCF performance evaluation discussed in Section~\ref{sec:GMCFLESEval} was
the first ever to be conducted on the framework. The results discussed in the
evaluation were the final best results obtained after a number of changes were
made to the framework to improve performance.

Also, during development of the GMCF parallelised LES, an unusual bug was
encountered caused by Fortran and C++ interoperability through POSIX threads.
The bug is not framework specific but will be discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:fortrancppinteroperability} as it is applicable to any
application using POSIX threads to call Fortran subroutines.

Figure~\ref{fig:gmcfbeforeandafter} shows the original GMCF performance results
alongside the best results for a fixed area run. As is clear from the graph,
GMCF was suffering from scalability issues, with the runtime increasing above
ten threads and causing a bathtub curve.

That weird Fortran/C++ stack array above a certain size sharing thing.
