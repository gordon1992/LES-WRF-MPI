MPI is the industry standard. MPI implementation created to act as a baseline
for GMCF performance. Also MPI implementation can be used by researchers. Also
using a mature API helped in the software engineering effort to provide a
Fortran module that abstracts as much detail of the MPI communication away from
the application developer such that porting existing single threaded code to MPI
is simpler.
