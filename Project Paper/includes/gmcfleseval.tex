MPI may be faster than GMCF but the GMCF performance is competitive. MPICH was
the initial implementation of the MPI 1.x standard so is around two decades old.
GMCF's implementation began in August 2014, less than a year ago and is
primarily aimed at model coupling, not parallelism. As GMCF matures it can be
expected that the performance gap will narrow.
