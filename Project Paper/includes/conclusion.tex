The LES parallelised by MPI has been shown to be fast and scalable up to 12
nodes with 144 cores. With MPI itself being more mature than the GMCF framework,
the MPI LES implementation is stable enough that it can be used straightaway on
shared- and distributed-memory systems by climate scientists.

The GMCF framework has been shown to support model parallelisation as well as
model coupling. The global reduction technique with spin locks and busy waiting
resulted in significantly improved performance and a scalable framework. All of
the performance changes to the framework benefit both the model parallelisation
and model coupling performance. Overall, with all of the substantial performance
improvements made, the performance results are highly competitive with MPI and,
as GMCF matures, the performance gap is expected to narrow further.

As discussed in future work, GMCF's capabilities are set to grow with
distributed-memory capabilities and more automation model coupling with
automation of model parallelisation in the pipeline. With this and the
performance improvements made, GMCF is set to be a strong model coupling and
parallelisation framework.
