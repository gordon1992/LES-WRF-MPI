MPI LES is a fast, scalable LES implementation that can be used straightaway.
GMCF shown to be competitive performance-wise. Future work will add distributed
memory parallelism abilities to GMCF. This will help GMCF obtain the goal of
being a replacement for OpenMP/MPI and existing model coupling frameworks in
one.
