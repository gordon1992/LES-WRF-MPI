The LES parallelised by MPI has been shown to be fast and scalable. With MPI
being mature over GMCF, the MPI LES implementation is stable enough that it can
be used straightaway on shared- and distributed-memory systems.

The GMCF framework has been shown to support model parallelisation as well as
model coupling. The performance results are competitive with MPI and, as GMCF
matures, the performance gap is expected to narrow further.

As future work has discussed, GMCF's capabilities are set to grow with
distributed-memory and more automation of parallelisation and model coupling in
the pipeline.
