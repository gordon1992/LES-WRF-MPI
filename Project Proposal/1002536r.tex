\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

The project's aim is to have co-simulation of WRF on CPU with LES on CPU, on
multiple nodes (for instance a Beowulf cluster). Currently the entire simulation
runs on a single node and as such is unable to scale for better performance. The
distributed co-simulation would require that data used and generated by the
simulation can be transferred directly between WRF and the LES. The ideal
situation is to have a generic method of doing this to also allow use of OpenCL
and accelerator devices to improve performance further.
