Scientists who study the geosciences have created software that models different
aspects of our planet's ecosystem; for example, ocean, wind, land, and
atmosphere. Each model is independently useful however for more accurate results
and to model more complex aspects of our climate, these models need to be
coupled together. The project proposed involves creating a distributed version
of the Large Eddy Simulator (LES) then coupling the LES with the Weather
Research and Forecasting model (WRF) using a model coupling framework. The
coupled system should scale to large computing clusters. Ideally the coupling
would also be generic such that the OpenCL-accelerated LES variant could be used
to allow greater performance on heterogeneous systems.
