Climate scientists have created software that independently models different
aspects of our planet's ecosystem; for example, ocean, wind, land, and
atmosphere. Each model is independently useful however for more accurate results
and to model more complex aspects of our climate, these models need to be
coupled together. The project proposed involves creating a distributed version
of the Large Eddy Simulator (LES) using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) then
coupling the LES with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) using a
model coupling framework. The coupled system should scale to large computing
clusters. Ideally the coupling will also be generic such that the
OpenCL-accelerated LES variant could also be used to allow greater performance
on heterogeneous systems.
