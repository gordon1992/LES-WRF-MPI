As stated before, there are a number of distinct stages to the project and each
stage requires a different approach.

The first stage involves creating a distributed version of the LES. This will
use MPI since it is the \textit{de facto} standard for cross-process
communication and OASIS3-MCT uses MPI1 capabilities for the coupling itself.
Even though OASIS3-MCT itself is limited to MPI1 capabilities, there should be
no issue using MPI2, or even MPI3 capabilities for the model-local parallelism
since MPI is mostly backward compatible. The dummy OASIS3-MCT coupling created
as part of the feasibility study was compiled with MPICH 3.1.2, an MPI3 capable
library, without issue.

The second stage involves coupling LES with WRF. For each timestep of WRF, LES
will run about one hundred times before data is exchanged. This will need to be
expressed in the coupling mechanism to avoid unnecessary data transfers and
minimal requirement for I/O operations. There are also potential problems with
modifying WRF for the OASIS coupling since WRF is a highly complex piece of
software and thus making changes, especially with a lack of experience with the
code base, could be challenging.

The evaluation of performance will have two parts: evaluating the MPI LES and
the coupled system performance as node count increases, perhaps with different
MPI implementations (say MPICH and OpenMPI). MPI libraries aren't strictly
interchangeable however with the availability of the wrapper compiler
\textit{mpifort} mixing MPI implementations may be straightforward.

The third stage involves comparing the differences in performance of the
OASIS3-MCT coupling to the GMCF coupling. GMCF is in a proof-of-concept stage
however has already been used to couple OpenMP WRF with the OpenCL accelerated
LES variant successfully.
