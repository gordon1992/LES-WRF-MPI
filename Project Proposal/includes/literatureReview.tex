Previous work falls under two related but largely independent areas: distributed
computing using MPI for data sharing via message passing, and model coupling.
Model couplers generally use MPI for cross-model communication however this is
generally hidden to the user under an API offered by the model coupling
framework. MPI specific work will be discussed followed by a section dedicated
to related work on model coupling.
