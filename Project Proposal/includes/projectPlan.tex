The project has a number of distinct stages with deliverables at the end of each
stage. There a number of major deliverables that have been identified. These
will be listed in the following section with the estimated delivery date in
bold. The estimated delivery dates correspond to an academic week.

\subsection{Deliverable Dates}

\subsection{Contingencies}

The project plan dates are based on a short feasibility study involving simple
MPI applications and dummy model couplings. If problems are encountered, due to
technical or temporal restrictions, alternative deliverables have been proposed.

The MPI LES Performance investigation would ideally span a range of node sizes
(up to 64 planned) and using different MPI implementations such as MPICH and
OpenMPI. Using multiple libraries could be too time consuming and, depending on
the implementations available, may be infeasible. Using one MPI implementation
would not be ideal however would still allow an in-depth review of the
scalability of a distributed LES to take place.

Given the lack of literature investigating the performance overheads of model
coupling in general and overhead of specific model couplers, an alternative
deliverable to the OASIS3-MCT and GMCF comparison would be to conduct a review
of the performance overhead of OASIS3-MCT. Since the current literature
\cite{StephanFrickenhausReneRedler2001, Mogensen} is at a disagreement between
model couplers having insignificant overhead to around 10\% overhead, this
alternative deliverable would be worthwhile work.
